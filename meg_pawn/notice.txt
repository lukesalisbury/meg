This work is based on the "Small C Compiler" by Ron Cain and James E. Hendrix,
as published in the book "Dr. Dobb's Toolbook of C", Brady Books, 1986.

The assembler version of the abstract machine (five times faster than the ANSI
C version and over two times faster than the GNU C version) was originally
written by Marc Peter (macpete@gmx.de).

The Just-In-Time compiler (JIT) included in this release was also written by
Marc Peter. As is apparent from the source code, the JIT is an evolutionary
step from his earlier abstract machine. The abstract machine has evolved
slightly since Marc Peter write the JIT and the JIT does currently not handle
the "sleep" instruction correctly.

The power user David "Bailopan" Anderson (see www.bailopan.net) found many bugs
in Pawn, and provided patches and detailed reports. He and his team also
provided a new "memory file" module that make the compiler process large scripts
quicker.

G.W.M. Vissers translated Marc Peter's JIT to NASM. This makes the JIT available
to Linux and Unix-like platforms.

Greg Garner from Artran Inc. compiled the source files as C++ files (rather
than C), added type casts where needed and fixed two bugs in the Pawn compiler
in the process. Greg Garner also wrote (and contributed) the extension module
for floating point support (files FLOAT.CPP and FLOAT.INC). I am currently
maintaining these modules, in order to keep them up to date with new features
in the Pawn toolkit.

Dieter Neubauer made a 16-bit version of the Pawn tools (meaning that a cell
is 16-bit, instead of the default 32-bit). His changes were merged in the
original distribution. Note that fixed or floating point arithmetic will be
near to impossible with a 16-bit cell.

Robert Daniels ported Pawn to ucLinux and corrected a few errors that had to
do with the "Endianness" of the CPU. His corrections make the Pawn compiler
and abstract machine better portable to Big Endian machines.

Frank Condello made a port of the Pawn toolkit to MacOS (CFM Carbon). His
changes are merged into the main source trunk.
